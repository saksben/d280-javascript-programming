# Interactive World Map

This university project was so that I could discover how to use existing frameworks, assets, and web content to enhance website functionality, as well as how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) and web services to add data capabilities to web applications.

Through it, I was able to:

* Design an interactive SVG world map with mouseover live stats using the World Bank API
* Implement Angular components, services, and event handlers to create a dynamic web application
* Automate SVG country paths to API calls so that individual country statistics are retrieved only on mouseover

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.0.0.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
